## Outreach Targets - Rough
This document outlines outreach targets. Our targets are rough. We have not validated assumptions yet, and they are not guarantees of future performance.

### Product
Equalify tests and records accessibility compliance for large institutions and supports those services. That is what we're selling.

### Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)
Equalify is a double bottom line company. We're focused on two KPIs:
- **Equalified Issues Per Customer (EICs)**: The number of accessibility fixes we log per customer. We're aiming to log 1 billion by Year 5.
- **Annual Reoccurring Revenue (ARR)**: Sales yields ARR. We aim to reach $50,000,000 in ARR by Year 5.

### Other Definitions
In addition to our KPIs, you will need to know some key terms to understand this document:
- **Lead**: A lead is someone we have a conversation with that expresses interest in leading us to a sale. Leads are not speculative. They must clearly say that they are interested in buying or have a direct connection with someone interested in buying.
- **Conversion Rate**: The conversion rate is the percentage of leads that turn into sales. 
- **Churn**: The number of users that leave Equalify each year. We're estimated

## Customer Categories
We group customers into four categories. Each category is defined by how much they spend, the number of pages we manage for them, and the percentage of leads we convert into that category. Here are our four customer categories:
- **Lead**: Spends $0 and manages 0 pages.
- **First 100**: Spends $5720/year and manages up to 150,000 pages. 2% of these customers are converted from leads.
- **Bronze**: Spends $25000/year and manages up to 150,000 pages. 1.25% of these customers are converted from leads.
- **Silver**: Spends $75000/year and manages up to 275,000 pages. .50% of these customers are converted from leads.
- **Gold**: Spends $115000/year and manages up to 500,000 pages. .25% of these customers are converted from leads.

### Assumptions
The following assumptions were made to arrive at our targets:
- **Issues per Web Page:** We assumed there are 50 accessibility issues on average per page.
- **Market Size:** We're going after 15,744 world Higher Ed institutions. We aim to capture 7.32% of that market by Year 5.
- **EIC Rate Per User**: Users solve 10% of their accessibility issues.
- **Churn**: 5% of users will quit Equalify year after year.
